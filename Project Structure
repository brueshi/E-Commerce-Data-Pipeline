## Component Details

### 1. Notebooks

#### `data_generator.ipynb`
This notebook contains the code to generate synthetic e-commerce data. It:
- Creates realistic customer profiles using Faker
- Generates a product catalog with categories and prices
- Simulates order history with seasonal patterns
- Produces order line items with appropriate relationships
- Saves all data to CSV files in the `data/` directory

The notebook includes detailed comments and markdown cells explaining the data generation approach and the patterns being simulated (like seasonal sales trends).

#### `pipeline.ipynb`
This notebook implements the ETL pipeline that:
- Extracts data from the CSV files
- Transforms it through data cleaning and feature engineering
- Loads the processed data into a SQLite database
- Creates views for common analytics queries
- Implements logging and error handling

The notebook breaks down each step of the ETL process with explanations and visualizations to help understand the data flow.

### 2. SQL Directory

#### `analysis_queries.sql`
This file contains a collection of SQL queries organized into sections:
- Customer analysis queries
- Product analysis queries
- Order analysis queries
- Complex multi-table analysis queries

Each query includes comments explaining its purpose and the business insights it provides.

### 3. Tests Directory

#### `test_data_generator.py`
Unit tests for the data generation functions that verify:
- Data is generated with the correct structure
- Relationships between tables are maintained
- Value ranges and distributions are as expected

#### `test_pipeline.py`
Unit tests for the ETL pipeline that verify:
- Each phase (extract, transform, load) works correctly
- Error handling functions as expected
- Data transformations produce the expected results
- Database schema is created properly

### 4. Data Directory

This directory contains the CSV files generated by the data generator. These files are:
- `customers.csv`: Customer demographic information
- `products.csv`: Product catalog with categories and prices
- `orders.csv`: Order header information with dates and totals
- `order_items.csv`: Order line items with products and quantities

These files are gitignored to avoid committing large data files to the repository.

### 5. Root Directory Files

#### `ecommerce.db`
The SQLite database created by the ETL pipeline. This is gitignored to avoid committing binary files to the repository.

#### `pipeline_log.txt`
A log file containing timestamped entries of pipeline execution events, errors, and performance metrics.

#### `requirements.txt`
Lists all Python dependencies needed to run the project, with version numbers for reproducibility.

#### `.gitignore`
Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore, such as data files, database files, Python cache files, and environment-specific files.

#### `README.md`
The main project documentation explaining the purpose, features, installation instructions, and usage examples.

## Code Organization

The project follows these principles:

1. **Modularity**: Each component has a single responsibility
2. **Documentation**: Extensive comments and markdown explanations
3. **Testability**: Code is structured to be easily testable
4. **Reproducibility**: Environment is fully specified in requirements.txt
5. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and logging throughout

## Development Workflow

1. Start by running `data_generator.ipynb` to create the synthetic dataset
2. Examine the generated data to understand its structure and patterns
3. Run `pipeline.ipynb` to process the data and create the database
4. Use the queries in `analysis_queries.sql` to analyze the processed data
5. Run tests to verify correctness of the implementation

## Extension Points

The project is designed to be extended in these ways:

1. Add new data sources by creating additional generator functions
2. Implement more complex transformations in the pipeline
3. Create additional SQL views for specialized analytics
4. Add incremental loading capabilities
5. Implement a simple dashboard using the processed data
